/*!
 @abstract Represents a <GMRIGHTSDKShareButton /> tag in TVML. Requires GMRIGHTSDKShareKit.framework to be linked.
 @discussion You should not need to use this class directly. Instead, make sure you
 initialize a `GMRIGHTSDKTVInterfaceFactory` instance correctly.

 The '<GMRIGHTSDKShareButton />' tag must also have the following attributes to define
  the share content:
 - `href` the url to share; or,
 - `action_type` and `object_url` and `key` where `action_type` is the Open Graph action type
 and `object_url` is a url that supports Open Graph and `key` is the Open Graph object name (see `FBSDKShareOpenGraphAction`).

 Examples:
 @code
 <GMRIGHTSDKShareButton href="http://developers.gmright.org/docs/tvos/tvml" />

 <GMRIGHTSDKShareButton action_type="video.watches" object_url="http://samples.ogp.me/453907197960619" key="movie"/>
